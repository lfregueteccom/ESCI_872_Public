    "This lab is intended to have you become familiar with the use of <ins>S</ins>ound <ins>S</ins>peed <ins>P</ins>rofiles (**SSP**s) as used in ocean mapping. Knowledge of the sound speed structure in the water column is critical when using acoustic mapping systems as it determines the geometry of the paths that signals traverse through the water, as well as the length of time it takes to travel those paths. Modeling these paths is typically achieved through a process called raytracing. This lab then has you create class `SSP` that holds a sound speed profile and provides raytracing methods. This class and its methods will be used in the last lab of the term where you will have to ray trace a multibeam echosounder beam. For that we will need a method that that takes the following arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "That function will have as input:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A starting depression angle.\n",
    "2. A starting depth.\n",
    "3. A two-way travel time.\n",
    "\n",
    "From that you will calculate two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. depth of the bottom strike.\n",
    "2. Radial distance out from transducer to the bottom strike.\n",
    "    \n",
    "To enable you to model the TWTT we will also create methods allowing you to determine:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How long it should take for sound to travel from a transducer to a flat seafloor of a given depth.\n",
    "2. How much of a depth and radial distance error would result from using a wrong sound speed profile.\n"

This system is designed  to take underway profiles of water column properties to a depth of up to ~300m from a vessel moving at 12 knots. The example data provided here is from an MVP-300 installed on the <ins>C</ins>anadian <ins>C</ins>oast <ins>G</ins>uard <ins>S</ins>hip (CCGS) Amundsen, Canada’s research icebreaker.\n",

From those measurements, the speed of sound in the water-column is modeled for use by the ship-mounted EM300 30 kHz multibeam sonar.\n",

    "The probe is dragged continuously behind the vessel at a depth just above the multibeam transducer. When released to free-fall, it falls at a speed of about $5 m/s$/ Therefore, it takes about one minute to drop from near the surface to $300 m$. In that time, the vessel has moved forward $60\\cdot 6 m/s = 360 m$ i.e., there is a total of $~700-800 m$ of cable deployed. The recovery speed is about $1 m/s$, so it takes about 10 minutes to winch the cable back in. As a result, it can deploy every at most ~15 minutes in depths of $300m$, if need be. For the example shown here, it was set to cycle every 30 minutes."

In this case we are picking a flat seabed at 250m depth.

Thus, you are tracing, keeping track of the TWTT accumulated until you arrive at your desired depth. As a result of this you will calculate an array of TWTTs and radial distances for the range of incidence angles you are testing for (in this example 0 to 70 degrees at 1-degree intervals).

    "Although we now have all the data, it is not a given that the data in the profile are sorted by depth. This is easily observed in the output of the code cell above. The records are written sequentially in time and so, *usually* each subsequent record has a greater depth associated to it. However, this not guaranteed! It may be that the MVP winch moved faster upwards than the probe was falling downwards through the water, leading to a reversal in the recorded depths. To make sure that this is not the case you should sort the profile's observed depths and sound speeds by depth.\n",

We want to sort by the depths which is the first of the values in the `zip` object tuples. To do this, we create a function `lambda x: x[0]` that, in this case, returns the value at the first index of the tuple i.e., the depth.\n",

    "We are however not done; we want to create the lists `processed_depths` and  `processed_ss` ordered by depth. The problem is that we now have a `list` `temp` of `tuples` as can be seen from the code cell above. What we want to do is to `unpack` each `tuple`, i.e., turn them into, in this case, two values. We achieve this using the unpacking operator `*`. This results in two iterables that can be zipped together. We then use the `map` function to maneuver through the resulting `zip` iterable object and extract the data as `lists`."

    "    \n",
    "A problem that may occur is the transducer rising above the level of the first sound speed observation. To address this, we should extend the profile to the surface. To extend the velocities to the surface we face a bit of a conundrum as we do not have an observed value there i.e., we are extrapolating. However, we do know that sound velocity profiles typically start close the surface and that surface waters are *usually* well mixed due to wave action. Thus, we may reasonably expect that the sound speed at the surface is the same as at the first sample in the profile:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if self.proc_depth[0] > 0:\n",
    "        self.proc_depth = np.insert(self.proc_depth,0,0)\n",
    "        self.proc_ss = np.insert(self.proc_ss,0,self.proc_ss[0])\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this assumption **fails** when there is no mixing at the surface - this is one of the reasons that surveying on calm seas can be problematic. "

As a result, a simplification is usually made which has the ocean consist only of horizontal layers with no lateral variability i.e., the gradient is one dimensional and occurs in the direction of depth. The primary result of this assumption is that the beam azimuth will remain constant, the ray only changes in depression angle as it penetrates through the layers, and that the gradient may be represented by just its magnitude (for 1-D vectors $\\lVert \\overrightarrow{g_t} \\lVert = \\overrightarrow{g_t} = g_t$ i.e., the vector is a scalar)\n",

Also, we are typically able to sample over a depth interval small enough for the sound speed does not vary significantly, thus we may approach the gradient by differencing the observations; as a result, we may ensure that the array `self.g` will represent the gradient of sound-speed for the layers $i$, that is:\n",

    "To keep the coding a little less confusing we will do something that from a computer science point may be frowned upon, but that will make your code significantly easier to read. Namely, we assign the `numpy array` `SSP.proc_depth` to `d`, similarly assign the array `SSP.proc_ss` to `c`, and the array `SSP.g` to `g`. This does not slow the code down by much; `c`, `d` and `g` are not copies of the data, but rather different **views** of the data i.e., no effort to allocate memory for them is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not aware of the concept of **views** you may end up with some surprising results e.g., after assigning `c = self.proc_ss` try setting `c[-1]=0` in the method, then use `print(self.proc_ss[-1])` after calling the method - you will be rewarded with a printed value of 0! To get a **copy** that you may alter without changing the original value you may use `c = self.proc_ss.copy()` instead of `c = self.proc_ss`. This comes at the penalty of having to allocate new memory to hold the new copy. Inexperienced programmers may struggle to debug code using data views, interpreting them as if they are data copies.\n",

They allow you to pass arguments to functions and methods that are very light (just a reference to the data, not the data itself), thus significantly speeding up execution of code.

    "    \n",
    "    4. We extended the profiles upwards to the surface in step B3.12 assuming \n",
    "       that the water near the surface is well mixed. Would this give a problem \n",

    "    5. in B3.15 we replaced the zero values in the array self.g using the Boolean \n",
